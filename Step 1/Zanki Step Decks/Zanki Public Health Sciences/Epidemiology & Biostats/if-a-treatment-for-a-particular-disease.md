life but doesn't result in a cure... (options = incidence,
prevalence, CFR, Mortality rate)
<div>
  - {{c1::Incidence}} is not affected
</div>
<div>
  - {{c1::Prevalence}} increases, because affected live longer
</div>
<div>
  - {{c1::CFR}} would depend on the stage of disease, but in
  general would decrease since less are likely to die during given
  time period
</div>
<div>
  - {{c1::Mortality Rate}} in general would decrease since you
  would likely have less deaths in a given time period
</div>
