      Secretory mechanisms of exocrine glands
    </div>

      <div>
        There are three different secretory mechanisms in the
        exocrine glands.
      </div>
      <div>
        (1) Exocytosis: Several vesicles, which detach from the
        Golgi apparatus, are transported to the cell membrane, to
        which they then attach, allowing the release of
        intravesicular contents (e.g. proteins, neurotransmitter)
        into the extracellular space.
      </div>
      <div>
        (2) In apocrine secretion, the secretion (e.g. milk lipid
        droplets) is detached with part of the apical cytoplasm and
        the cell membrane. As a result, the gland cell becomes
        smaller.
      </div>
      <div>
        (3) Holocrine secretion only occurs in sebaceous glands.
        The secretion is released by apoptosis of the gland cell.
        During the course of maturation, the cell continuously
        produces sebum. Cell organelles and the nucleus are
        degraded and the cell subsequently disintegrates, with its
        entire content forming part of the secretion.

        Sebaceous gland (green overlay) can be seen in the dermis.
        The gland consists of groups of ball-shaped sebocytes (1).
        Maturation and migration of sebocytes begin on the basement
        membrane (2). The arrector pili muscle (3) consists of
        several spindle-shaped, smooth muscle cells (leiomyocytes)
        that insert into the hair shaft. The contraction of
        leiomyocytes results in piloerection and leads to increased
        secretion of sebum from the glands.
