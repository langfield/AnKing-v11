        The different cell junction types differ in their molecular
        structure; however, they all contain certain types of
        transmembrane proteins. The transmembrane proteins of the
        zonula adhaerens, desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes are
        connected to a component of the cytoskeleton, but also to
        structures external to the cell. The tight junction
        proteins claudin and occludin are linked to actin filaments
        of the cytoskeleton by additional proteins (not shown).
        Their extracellular domains interact with one another and
        close the gaps between epithelial cells. Gap junctions are
        similar to ion channels in that they are permeable to small
        molecules and alternate between open and closed states. In
        addition to their communication function, gap junctions
        support the adhesion of neighboring cells.
