### Extra
1. Myofibril relaxation is a sign of reversible injury in cardiac
myocytes, which occurs within the first 30 minutes of severe
ischemia. Myofibril relaxation corresponds with intracellular ATP
depletion and lactate accumulation due to anaerobic glycolysis
during this period.
<div>
  <div>
    2. Disaggregation of polysomes denotes the dissociation of rRNA
    from mRNA in reversible ischemic/hypoxic injury. Depletion of
    intracellular ATP is thought to promote the dissolution of
    polysomes into monosomes as well as the detachment of ribosomes
    from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Disaggregation of
    polysomes results in impaired protein synthesis.
  </div>
  <div>
    3. Disaggregation of granular and fibrillar elements of the
    nucleus is associated with reversible cell injury. Another
    common nuclear change associated with reversibel cell injury is
    clumping of nuclear chromatin, perhaps secondary to a decrease
    in intracellular pH.
  </div>
  <div>
    4. Triglyceride droplet accumulation is characteristic of
    reversible cellular injury, especially in hepatocytes, and also
    in striated muscle cells and renal cells. The fatty change may
    result from the decreased synthesis of intracellular proteins
    that occurs with cell injury. In the hepatocyte, decreased
    production of lipid acceptor proteins prevents the normal
    incorporation of triglycerides into lipoproteins. Since
    triglycerides cannot be rapidly exported from the cell in the
    form of lipoproteins, the accumulate intracellularly.
  </div>
  <div>
    5. Glycogen loss is another early and reversible cellular
    response to injury. As a result of lowered mitochondrial ATP
    production, ATP must be supplied to the cel via anaerobic
    glycolysis of glucose derived from the cell's glycogen stores.
    Myocardial glycogen stores may be completely depleted within 30
    minutes of onset of severe ischemia.
