        Wakefulness (W): relaxed stage of being awake (alpha waves)

        (B) stage 1: falling asleep (lightest sleep with alpha and
        theta waves) (C) stage 2: beginning of sleep (light sleep
        with sleep spindles, theta waves, and K-complexes) (D)
        stage 3: transition between medium and deep sleep (delta
        waves) (E) stage 4: deep sleep (over 50% of delta waves)

      <div>
        The last three patterns show the electroencephalogram
        (EEG), the electrooculogram (EOG; measures eye movement)
        and the electromyogram (EMG) of an index finger during REM
        sleep (dreaming sleep). The REM stages typically occur at
        the end of the sleep cycle and are not associated with any
        of the above-mentioned stages (i.e. they form their own
        stage).

        Compared to a healthy person (A), a person suffering from
        depression (B) has a longer latency of sleep onset, reduced
        REM latency, prolonged first REM sleep, an increased
        occurrence of REM sleep in the second part of the night,
        and an increasing duration of REM sleep throughout the
        night. In general, depressed people sleep less deeply and
        are awake more often during the night. Both representations
        are simplified for didactic purposes (i.e. common, brief
        periods of arousal during the REM sleep are not shown
        here).
