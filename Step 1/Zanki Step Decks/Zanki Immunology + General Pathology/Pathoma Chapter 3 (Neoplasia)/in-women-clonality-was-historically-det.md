### Text
<div>
  In <b>women</b>, clonality was historically determined by
  analysis of {{c1::Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase}} isoforms
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  - because neoplastic cells are derived from a single progenitor,
  this characteristic allows a pathologist to identify whether a
  sample of tissue is neoplastic or not
</div>- This method is almost entirely historical now and has been
replaced by looking at <b>microsatellites /</b> <b>methylation
patterns</b> (useful in women AND men)
