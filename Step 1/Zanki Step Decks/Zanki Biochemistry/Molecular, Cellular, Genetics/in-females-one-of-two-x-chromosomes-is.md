### Text
<div>
  <div>
    In <u>females</u>, one of two X-chromosomes is condensed and
    its genes turned <i>off</i> by {{c1::cytosine
    methylation::specific action}}, forming heterochromatin
    (lyonization)
  </div>
</div>

### Extra
Also known as X-chromosome inactivation; random process that occurs
at about time of gastrulation in epiblast:
<div>
  <div>
    <div>
      - Both X genes express Xist RNA at low levels, Xist RNA coats
      DNA and recruits methylation enzymes to <u>inactivate coated
      DNA</u>
    </div>
    <div>
      - HOWEVER, due to an <u>autosomally encoded blocking
      factor</u> (Blocking factor prevents xist coating DNA) and
      <u>expression of tsix</u> (tsix RNA is antisense for xist and
      inhibits it) <b>randomly</b> by one of the X genes; one
      chromosome is NOT coated
    </div>
    <div>
      - The X chromosome that remains coated becomes inactivated,
      and the localizes to the periphery forming Barr bodies
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
