### Text
<b>Zellweger syndrome</b> is a result of mutations in {{c1::PEX}}
genes that encode for <u>peroxins</u>, which are required for
normal assembly of peroxisomes

### Extra
- Peroxisomes don't form, resulting in pathology due to the accumulation of what they were supposed to metabolize / lack of what they were supposed to synthesize
