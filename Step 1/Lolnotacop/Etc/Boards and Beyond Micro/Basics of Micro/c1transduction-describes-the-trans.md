        Bacterial transduction is the process of gene transfer
        between bacteria via bacteriophages.

        Top panel: generalized transduction (lytic cycle via
        virulent phages) A bacteriophage attaches itself to the
        bacterial cell wall and injects its DNA into the bacterium.
        The viral DNA replicates within the infected bacterium and
        is incorporated into protein shells (phage capsids) to form
        numerous bacteriophages. The new bacteriophages lyse the
        bacterial cell wall and are released to infect other
        bacteria in the surrounding environment. A section of the
        bacterial genome may be incorporated into a viral capsid
        and be transferred to another bacterium, forming a
        recombinant bacterium. As any portion of the bacterial
        genome may be transferred, in a process known as
        generalized transduction.
      </div>
      <div>
        Bottom panel: specialized transduction (lysogenic and lytic
        cycle via temperate phages) Once the bacteriophage has
        injected its DNA into the bacterium, the viral DNA is
        incorporated into the bacterial genome at a specific
        location and remains inactive as a prophage (lysogenic
        phase). Upon activation (e.g. with heat or UV radiation),
        the viral DNA replicates, is incorporated into phage
        capsids, and is released into the surrounding environment
        through lysing of the host bacterial cell wall (lytic
        phase). During this process, the bacterial DNA flanking the
        viral DNA is also incorporated into the viral capsid and
        transferred to another bacterium, forming a recombinant
        bacterium. Because a specific portion of the bacterial
        genome is being transferred, the process is known as
        specialized transduction.

        The panel on the right summarizes the major difference
        between generalized and specialized transduction.
