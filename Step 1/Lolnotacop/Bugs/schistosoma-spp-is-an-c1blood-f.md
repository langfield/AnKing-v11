      Life cycle of schistosomes

      <div>
        An infected human, the definitive host of schistosomes,
        excretes schistosome eggs in urine or feces (yellow and
        brown arrow). The eggs hatch in water and release
        miracidia. These flat, ciliated larva penetrate specific
        freshwater snails, which then act as intermediate hosts. In
        the snail, the miracidia develop into sporocysts, which
        reproduce asexually to form cercaria. Cercaria are then
        released back in the water. When humans come in contact
        with contaminated water, cercaria can penetrate the skin
        and enter the circulation. As they lose their tail, the
        cercaria develop into schistosomula, which then mature into
        adult schistosomes in the venous system. At this point, a
        male and female adult worm mate and migrate to the veins of
        the target organs (liver, intestine, bladder). The female
        worm lies folded in the longitudinal cleft (schist) of the
        male worm and lays eggs, which causes inflammation of the
        organs. As a result of the inflammation, the eggs can
        penetrate the wall of the organ and enter the lumen of the
        intestine or bladder (depending on the species), and they
        are then eliminated in feces or urine.
