During <b>phase I blockade</b> using <u>depolarizing</u> NMJ
blockers, <b>TOF stimulation</b> shows <b>{{c1::equal
reduction}}</b> of all four twitches

### Extra
these are equal because the presynaptic acetylcholine receptor
stimulation helps to mobilize presynaptic acetylcholine vesicles
for release

        Supramaximal stimuli are administered to the ulnar nerve by
        two electrodes placed on the venteromedial surface of the
        distal forearm. The intensity of adductor pollicus muscle
        contraction in response to ulnar nerve stimulation can be
        measured objectively using a piezoelectric sensor attached
        to the thumb. Neuromuscular monitoring is used to measure
        the degree of muscle paralysis that occurs with the use of
        neuromuscular blocking agents.

        <div>
          Train-of-four stimulations are done by delivering four
          successive supramaximal stimuli (at 500 ms intervals) to
          a peripheral nerve. Those groups of four stimulations are
          repeatedly delivered to evaluate the resulting pattern of
          muscular response.
        </div>
        <div>
          Normally, the resulting muscular responses (as measured
          via electromyography) should be equally strong (both
          within groups of four consecutive responses and over a
          succession of consecutive groups of such responses).
        </div>
        <div>
          If nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g.
          rocuronium) are administered, the amplitude of muscular
          responses decreases within a group of four consecutive
          responses (that the amplitude of the fourth response is
          significantly lower than that of the first one of the
          same group). This phenomenon is also referred to as
          “fade.”
        </div>
        <div>
          The effects of depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs
          (e.g. succinylcholine) are subdivided into two phases: In
          phase I, the drug binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine
          receptor, inducing a single, persistent depolarization.
          Electromyographically, each of the individual responses
          in a group of four will be decreased by the same
          percentage, and the overall muscular responsiveness
          between consecutive groups of stimuli steadily decreases
          over time. If depolarizing neuromuscular agents are
          administered over a prolonged amount of time or a high
          dose is given, phase II may occur. In this phase, there
          is a fade in the muscular response, resembling the
          phenomenon seen in nondepolarizing agents.
          Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. neostigmine)
          potentiate the effects of depolarizing neuromuscular
          blocking drugs during phase I.
