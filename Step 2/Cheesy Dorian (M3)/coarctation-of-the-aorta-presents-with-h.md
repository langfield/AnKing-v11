### Text
<b>Coarctation of the aorta</b> presents with <u>HTN in
{{c1::upper}} extremities</u> and <u>hypotension in {{c1::lower}}
extremities</u>; a(n) {{c1::midsystolic or continuous}}
<u>murmur</u> heard best {{c1::over the back (interscapular
area)}}; and {{c1::<u>notching of the ribs</u>}} on CXR. Treat with
{{c2::surgical decompression}}

### Extra
<div>
  Murmur can be systolic OR continuous. In contrast, PDA is a
  continuous murmur heard at the left subclavicular region that is
  "machinery" or "to-and-fro", reflecting the wide pulse pressure
  it creates
</div>
<div>
  All symptoms related to too much blood flow in the upper half of
  the body (headache, cerebral aneurysms, aortic dissection) and
  too little blood flow in the lower half of the body
  (underdevelopment, cold legs, claudication w/ exercise, leg
  fatigue, delayed femoral pulses). ECG shows LVH.
</div>Blood pressure differential between the upper and lower
extremities is seen with aortic coarctation, which can present with
hypertension, headaches, blurred vision, epistaxis, and lower
extremity claudication (due to reduced blood flow). A continuous
murmur can be heard at the left interscapular area due to turbulent
flow across the coarctation or through large collateral vessels.
<div>
  <div>
    The diagnosis of CoA is confirmed by echocardiogram, which
    visualizes the aortic narrowing and also helps identify other
    commonly associated congenital heart defects (e.g. bicuspid
    aortic valve)
  </div>
  <div>
    Alternative treatment option: percutaneous balloon aortoplasty
  </div>
  <div><img src="L12140.jpg" style="" class=""></div>Congenital
  heart defects only account for 2% of heart disease in adults.
  They are low-yield.
