    <li>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a standardized
    modality of psychotherapy that targets persistent maladaptive
    thought patterns and behaviors. CBT is used as monotherapy or
    in combination with medication to treat a variety of mental
    illnesses (eg, anxiety, mood, personality, somatic symptom, and
    eating disorders). Treatment is generally time limited
    (approximately 5-20 sessions). Patients work with therapists to
    identify and change cognitive distortions, such as
    overgeneralization (e.g. patient believes ALL of her colleagues
    dislike her), catastrophizing (fears being fired), and
    minimizing positive events (disregards that she is being
    considered for promotion), as well as changing avoidance
    behaviors that stem from these distortions.
    <li>(Choice A) Biofeedback involves using signals from the body
    (e.g. heart rate, muscle tension, skin temperature, blood
    pressure) as indicators of emotional distress. Patients are
    taught to identify and control their responses to various
    stimuli.
    <li>(Choice C) Dialectical behavioral therapy was developed for
    borderline personality disorder and targets the emotional
    dysregulation and self-destructive and suicidal behaviors
    associated with this disorder.
    <li>(Choice D) Interpersonal psychotherapy is an
    evidenced-based therapy for depression that focuses on the
    interplay between depressive symptoms and interpersonal
    stressors. This patient suffers more from anxiety than
    depression. Her cognitive distortions and avoidance behaviors
    are more suited to treatment with CBT.
    <li>(Choice E) Motivational interviewing is commonly used to
    treat substance abuse and involves the therapist assuming a
    nonjudgmental stance, acknowledging ambivalence, focusing on
    the patient's motivation for change, and tolerating resistance
    to change.
    <li>(Choice F) Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on the role
    of unconscious conflict and gaining insight into how past
    experience shapes present situations. It does not specifically
    target thought patterns and avoidance behaviors.
    <li>(Choice G) Supportive psychotherapy is used to reinforce a
    patient's ability to cope with stressors and is commonly used
    for low-functioning patients or patients in crisis who are at
    risk of decompensation. For a more stable patient, like this
    woman, CBT provides a more in-depth and targeted approach.
