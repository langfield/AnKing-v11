    <li>Nocturnal panic attacks
      <ul>
        <li>Is characterized by an <u>abrupt awakening from NREM
        sleep</u> with a sensation of chest tightness and choking.
      </ul>
    <li>REM sleep behavior disorder
      <ul>
        <li>Is characterized by <b>repeated episodes of aggressive
        motor behaviors</b> (dream enactment) or complex motor
        behaviors that occur during REM sleep (kicking in bed,
        pushing over the nightstand, and moving furniture out of
        the way). It is rare in children, and patients are able to
        recall their dream content, unlike sleep terrors, in which
        there is no memory of the incident. However, the patient is
        unaware of their night time movements. REM sleep behavior
        disorder is more likely to occur in older adult men. If
        frequent and recurrent, it <u>may be a prodromal sign of
        neurodegeneration</u> in patients with Parkinson disease or
        dementia with Lewy bodies.
        <li>It occurs with other prodromal symptoms such as subtle
        motor deficits (e.g. changes in gait), anosmia, and
        constipation.
      </ul>
    <li>Sleep walking/terrors
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Another type of NREM parasomnia, involves walking or
        running around. The child has a blank stare and is
        unresponsive and not fully awake. This patient jumps out of
        bed, which can be seen in sleep terrors, but does not move
        around as in sleep walking. She also has a panicky scream
        that does not occur in sleep walking.
        <li><u>Sleep terrors</u> and <u>sleepwalking</u> are
        examples of <b>non-REM sleep arousal disorders</b> that
        typically occur in younger patients during deep non-REM
        sleep. In contrast to REM sleep behavior disorder, they
        typically occur during the first third of the sleep period.
        There is a longer period of confusion before becoming fully
        alert, and individuals do not recall any concurrent dreams.
