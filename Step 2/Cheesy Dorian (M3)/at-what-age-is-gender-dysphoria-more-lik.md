  At what age is <b>gender dysphoria</b> more likely to be
  enduring?

  {{c1::Adolescence}}

### Extra
<ol type="1" start="1">
  <li>Exploring sexuality in adolescence is developmentally
  appropriate. However, gender dysphoria is diagnosed when there is
  an intense and persistent desire to be another gender, which
  causes significant distress. Gender dysphoria in early childhood
  does not always persist; when experienced through adolescence, as
  in this patient, and especially into puberty, gender dysphoria is
  more likely to be enduring and should be addressed; discussions
  should not be delayed.
  <li>This patient has told no one but the physician about how he
  feels as he fears being rejected or not taken seriously. People
  with gender dysphoria are at increased risk of victimization,
  depression, and anxiety; the more support they get from family,
  friends and professionals, the better the outcome.
  Hormone-suppression therapy can be offered by Tanner stage 2 of
  development to delay puberty and give patients time to decide how
  to proceed. The medication has many side effects, so any decision
  about it should be made with support from family and/or friends,
  if possible.
