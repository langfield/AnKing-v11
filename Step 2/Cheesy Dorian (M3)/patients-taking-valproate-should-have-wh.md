### Text
Patients taking <b>valproate</b> should have which <u>tests prior
to therapy</u> and <u>regular thereafter</u>?
<div>
  {{c1::Liver tests}}
</div>

### Extra
"This patient's symptoms of malaise, anorexia, and nausea and findings of right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness and elevated aminotransferases are consistent with liver injury.  In the absence of underlying liver disease, this is most likely due to drug-induced liver injury.  Among the psychotropic medications listed, hepatotoxicity is most commonly associated with the anticonvulsant mood stabilizer valproate.  Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, anorexia, and nausea.  Most cases occur during the first 6 months of treatment. Patients receiving valproate should have liver tests prior to therapy and regularly thereafter.  In addition to hepatotoxicity, valproate is also rarely associated with thrombocytopenia."
