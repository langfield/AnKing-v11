<b>Hypoglycemia</b> and <b>elevated PT/PTT</b> are more common in

### Extra
<i>Acute fatty liver of pregnancy can cause acute hepatic failure
in the third trimester or early postpartum period. Acute fatty
liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is characterized by nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, and significant elevations of liver markers in the
third trimester. <b>Most patients will have a prolonged PT</b> and
<b>PTT</b>, <b>hypoglycemia</b>, and <b>encephalopathy</b>. Many
features of AFLP overlap with those of HELLP syndrome, but patients
with AFLP are more likely to have additional <b>extrahepatic
complications such as leukocytosis</b>, <b>hypoglycemia</b>, and
<b>acute kidney injury</b>.Severe hypertension is less likely in
AFLP than in HELLP syndrome. However, hemolysis, proteinuria and
thrombocytopenia are more suggestive of HELLP syndrome.</i>
