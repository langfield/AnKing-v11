What is the difference between <b>hypertensive urgency</b> and
<b>hypertensive emergency</b>?
<div>
  Hypertensive emergency is characterized by {{c1::end-organ
  damage}}
</div>

  Severe hypertension (>180/120 mm Hg) can lead to
  autoregulation failure, vascular endothelial disruption,
  fibrinous deposition, and narrowed vascular lumen. Hypertensive
  urgency is defined as severe hypertension without symptoms or
  end-organ damage. Hypertensive emergency is defined as marked
  severe hypertension associated with malignant hypertension or
  hypertensive encephalopathy.
</div>Malignant hypertension is usually seen in patients with
long-standing and uncontrolled hypertension. It is associated with
retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and/or papilledema. Patients also
can develop malignant nephrosclerosis (acute renal failure,
hematuria, and proteinuria). However, renal findings are not always
present and are not required for the diagnosis of malignant
hypertension. Hypertensive encephalopathy is associated with
cerebral edema due to breakthrough vasodilation from failure of
autoregulation. Patients usually develop insidious onset of
headache, nausea, and vomiting followed by non-localizing
neurologic symptoms (e.g. restlessness, confusion, seizures/coma if
untreated). Patients also can develop subarachnoid or intracerebral
hemorrhage. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur as a
complication of long-standing uncontrolled hypertension. However,
its presence is not a specific criterion for diagnosing malignant
hypertension. Blood pressure >180/120 mm Hg is also seen in
hypertensive urgency and is not specific for defining malignant
hypertension. Sudden increases in blood pressure can abruptly
increase left ventricular afterload, leading to left ventricular
failure and acute pulmonary edema. Although hypertensive emergency
can lead to the finding of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, it is
not a specific diagnostic criterion for malignant hypertension.
