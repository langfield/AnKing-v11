  <i>Sundowning is a symptom of Alzheimer's disease and other forms
  of dementia. It's also known as “late-day confusion.” If someone
  you care for has dementia, their confusion and agitation may get
  worse in the late afternoon and evening. In comparison, their
  symptoms may be less pronounced earlier in the day</i>
