      - Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS])
      causes the most common neonatal infection that is acquired by
      exposure to colonized amniotic fluid after rupture of
      membranes. Screening for GBS and administering intrapartum
      antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to high-risk women have markedly
      reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal GBS disease.
      However, GBS colonization may be transient and screening is
      most accurate if performed 3-5 weeks prior to the estimated
      delivery date. In patients who show no signs of preterm
      labor, universal screening occurs at 35-37 weeks gestation to
      increase the likelihood of having an accurate result in
      anticipation of labor at 40-42 weeks gestation. Culture of
      the vagina and rectum is the most sensitive screening method
      for GBS.
    </div>
    <div>
      - The exceptions to universal screening include a history of
      GBS bacteriuria at any point during the current pregnancy or
      invasive early-onset GBS disease in a prior child. These
      high-risk patients should receive IAP as their urogenital
      tract colonization is more likely to persist and spread to
      the newborn.
    </div>
    <div>
      - Women who miss screening (unknown GBS status) should be
      treated in labor if they are at <37 weeks gestation,
      develop an intrapartum fever, or have rupture of membranes
      for >18 hours; otherwise, their risk of transmission is
      low. Women who are GBS negative do not need antibiotic
      prophylaxis for prolonged rupture of membranes as
      over-treatment may result in antibiotic resistance or
      emergence of other neonatal pathogens.
    </div>
    <div>
      - Penicillin is the prophylactic agent of choice; it reaches
      therapeutic levels in the amniotic fluid and fetus without
      toxicity and has a narrow spectrum of coverage, minimizing
      the risk of resistance. Prophylaxis should be given 4 hours
      before delivery.
