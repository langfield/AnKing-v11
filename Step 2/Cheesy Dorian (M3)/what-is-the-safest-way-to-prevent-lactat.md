### Text
What is the safest way to prevent lactation in a postpartum woman?
<div>
  {{c1::<b>Conservative</b>: supportive bra, ice packs,
  analgesics}}
</div>

### Extra
<i>Engorgement itself creates a chain of events that lead to
cessation of the lactation process due to negative inhibition of
prolactin release. <b>Lactation suppression is accomplished by
wearing a comfortable, supportive bra, avoidance of nipple
stimulation and manipulation, application of ice packs to the
breasts, and NSAIDs to reduce inflammation and pain</b>. Breast
binding is not recommended for lactation suppression due to the
risk of mastitis, plugged ducts, and increased pain. In addition, a
tight bra or binder may lead to inadvertent nipple stimulation.</i>
