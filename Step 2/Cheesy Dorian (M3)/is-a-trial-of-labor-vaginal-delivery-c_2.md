      - The risk of uterine rupture is greatest in laboring
      patients with prior uterine surgery, particularly a prior
      classical (vertical) cesarean delivery or a prior myomectomy
      that was extensive or entered the uterine cavity (e.g. during
      removal of intramural or submucosal fibroids)

    <div>
      - In contrast, patients with either a classical cesarean
      delivery or an extensive myomectomy are delivered via
      cesarean delivery at 36-37 weeks gestation. When these
      patients present in labor, urgent laparotomy and delivery are
      required. Further management is determined by intraoperative
      findings. If uterine rupture has occurred, delivery is
      typically through the rupture site and a uterine repair is
      performed. If the uterus is unruptured, a hysterotomy (i.e.
      cesarean delivery) is performed. Expectant management for a
      vaginal delivery is generally contraindicated in patients
      with prior classical cesarean delivery or extensive
      myomectomy.
