<b>Hypertension</b> is diagnosed with <u>{{c1::two}} separate blood
pressures</u> taking over a span of {{c1::four}} weeks

### Extra
The arm should be at heart level, and the patient seated comfortably. Have the patient sit quietly for at least five minutes before measuring blood pressure. Make sure the patient has not ingested caffeine or smoked cigarettes in the past 30 minutes. Use a cuff of adequate size. The bladder within the cuff should encircle at least 80% of the arm. To evaluate target organ damage and assess overall cardiovascular risk, order a urinalysis, chemistry panel, fasting glucose, lipid panel, and ECG.
