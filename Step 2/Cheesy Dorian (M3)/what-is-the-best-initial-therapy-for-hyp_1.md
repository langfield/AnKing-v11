### Extra
<div>
  <i><b>HTN Lifestyle modifications</b> key points:</i>
</div>
<div>
  <i>- <b>weight loss</b> is the most effective (an attending of
  mine explained it well: think of all the vasculature that's added
  with that weight, that's how much more resistance and distance
  the heart has to pump against; luckily, the effect is just as
  beneficial when you lose the weight)</i>
</div>
<div>
  <i>- HTN dietary changes typically involve less fat/red meat and
  more fish/vegetables</i>
</div>
<div>
  <i>- Smoking cessation does not stop HTN progression, but it is
  vital in preventing further cardiovascular disease</i>
</div>
