### Text
What is management of a patient taking <b>lamotrigine</b> who
develops a <u>small maculopapular rash</u>?
<div>
  {{c1::Lamotrigine should be discontinued at the first sign of
  rash and substituted with another agent}}
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  - A mild form occurs in up to 10% of those treated, however, the
  challenge of predicting the eventual severity of
  lamotrigine-induced rash at the outset warrants discontinuation.
</div>
<div>
  - <u>One of the most significant side effects of lamotrigine is a
  drug rash</u>, a mild form of which occurs in up to 10% of those
  treated. The more severe mucocutaneous rashes of
  <b>Stevens-Johnson syndrome</b> (<10% body surface area skin
  detachment) and <b>toxic epidermal necrolysis</b> (>30%
  detachment) occur at a rate of 0.1% (10%-30% detachment is known
  as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap)
</div>
<div>
  - Because of the <b>challenge of predicting the eventual severity
  of lamotrigine-induced rash at the outset</b>, lamotrigine should
  be discontinued at the first sign of rash and substituted with
  another agent. Most cases of lamotrigine-induced rash develop
  within the first 2 months of therapy. Risk of rash is greater in
  children and appears to be higher when coprescribed with
  valproate or when the dose is increased rapidly.
