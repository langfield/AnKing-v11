  - The most important intervention for preventing the spread of
  HIV from mother to child is administration of combination
  antiretroviral therapy to the mother throughout pregnancy.
  Antiviral therapy should be initiated as soon as possible during
  pregnancy (even during the first trimester), regardless of
  maternal CD4 count or viral load. Antenatal combination therapy
  is the best way to suppress maternal HIV and prevent
  transplacental or perinatal acquisition by the infant. Mothers
  with undetectable viral loads at delivery have <1% risk of
  transmitting the infection to their infants.
</div>
<div>
  The 3-drug regimen should consist of 2 nucleoside reverse
  transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a non-nucleoside reverse
  transcriptase inhibitor or a protease inhibitor. An NRTI with
  good placental transfer (e.g. zidovudine, tenofovir) should be
  administered. Zidovudine should be administered to the neonate
  for >6 weeks.
