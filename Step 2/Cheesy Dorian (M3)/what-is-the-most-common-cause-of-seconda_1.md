What is the <u>most common cause</u> of <b>secondary
hypertension</b> in young women?

### Extra
Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) can cause mild elevations in blood
pressure and sometimes lead to overt hypertension (up to 5% of
chronic OCP users). Women who developed hypertension during a
previous pregnancy or have a family history of hypertension are
more likely to develop hypertension from OCP use. The mechanism is
unclear but possibly due to an <u>estrogen-mediated increase in
hepatic angiotensinogen synthesis or other effects on the
renin-angiotensin system</u>. Discontinuing OCPs can reduce the
blood pressure over a 2- to 12-month period and can often correct
the problem. However, there should be a discussion with the patient
about the risk of continuing the OCP versus the benefit of stopping
the drug in addition to considering alternate contraceptive
methods. <u>If the elevated blood pressure persists after OCP
discontinuation, then</u> <b>essential hypertension</b> is the most
probable diagnosis and lifestyle modification can be attempted.
Diet and exercise are effective for reducing blood pressure in
obese patients (5-20 mm Hg systolic reduction per 10-kg loss) but
not as effective in nonobese patients.
