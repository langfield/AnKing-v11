          Psychoanalysis is therefore considered insight oriented.
          Patients best suited for psychoanalysis have the
          following characteristics: not psychotic, intelligent,
          and stable in relationships and daily living. Treatment
          is usually 3–5 days per week for many years. During
          therapy sessions, the patient usually lies on a couch
          with the therapist seated out of view.
