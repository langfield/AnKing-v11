### Text
Patients with {{c1::hypo::hypo/hyper}}thyroidism are at increased
risk for <b>carpal tunnel syndrome</b>

### Extra
<div>
  "Hypothyroidism may be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome
  because hypothyroid patients tend to retain fluid in connective
  tissues due to an accumulation of mucopolysaccarides, a substance
  that accumulates abnormally in hypothyroidism. This exacerbates
  the swelling and worsens the compression of the median nerve as
  it passes under the connective tissues overlying the wrist."
