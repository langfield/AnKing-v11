  <div>
    - The <u>second stage of labor</u> begins when the cervix is 10
    cm dilated and ends with fetal delivery. The duration of the
    second stage is affected by parity and use of neuraxial
    anesthesia. <b>Progression during the second stage is evaluated
    by determining the</b> <font color="#FC0280">fetal
    station</font>, which measures the descent of the presenting
    part through the pelvis.
  </div>
  <div>
    -<font color="#FC0280">An arrested second stage occurs when
    there is no fetal descent after pushing for >3 hours in
    nulliparous patients or >2 hours in multiparous
    patients</font>. The most common cause of a prolonged or
    arrested second stage is <b>fetal malposition</b>. The fetal
    position is the relationship of the fetal presenting part to
    the maternal pelvis. The optimal fetal position is <u>occiput
    anterior</u> as it facilitates the cardinal movements of labor.
    Deviations from this position (e.g. occiput transverse, occiput
    posterior) can cause cephalopelvic disproportion and arrest of
    the second stage.
  </div>
  <div>
    - Fetal presentation refers to the lowest part of the fetus in
    the maternal pelvis. The most common presentation (seen in this
    patient) is vertex, in which the fetal occiput is the lowest
    presenting part. Malpresentation refers to any nonvertex
    presentation (e.g. face, breech) and can cause labor
    protraction.
  </div>
  <div>
    - <u>Inadequate contractions</u> (e.g. <3 contractions in 10
    minutes, soft to palpation) are the most common cause of a
    <u>protracted first stage of labor</u>. This patient's
    contractions are regular (every 2-3 minutes) and firm on
    palpation and, therefore, are likely adequate.
  </div>
  <div>
    - <b>Maternal obesity is a risk factor</b> for protraction and
    arrest during the first and second stages of labor. This
    patient was underweight prior to pregnancy and gained an
    appropriate amount of weight during pregnancy.
  </div>
  <div>
    - Molding is the change in fetal head shape caused by pressure
    from maternal expulsive efforts. This occurs as the fetal head
    attempts to adapt to the shape of the maternal pelvis to
    facilitate delivery. Molding of the fetal head with an arrest
    of descent is suggestive of cephalopelvic disproportion, not
    poor maternal effort.
