### Text
<div>
  <b>{{c1::β-adrenergic}} antagonists</b> are associated with
  <u>reduced</u> <b>insulin sensitivity</b> and increased risk of
  developing <b>type 2 diabetes</b>
</div>

### Extra
Normally, α-1 receptor stimulation causes vasoconstriction, which
reduces glucose uptake into skeletal muscles; β-2 receptor
stimulation opposes this effect
<div>
  In the presence of β blockade, α-1-mediated effects are
  unopposed, leading to further reduction in glucose uptake, higher
  levels of circulating glucose, and resultant increased insulin
  secretion from the pancreas
</div>
<div>
  Insulin resistance is effectively increased (i.e. insulin
  sensitivity is reduced)
</div>
<div>
  As a result, patients experience weight gain. A reduction in
  lipolysis in adipocytes (which is largely β-1 receptor-mediated)
  likely also contributes to weight gain
