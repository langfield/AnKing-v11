### Text
What is the <i>management</i> for <u>pregnant patients</u> with
<i style="font-weight: bold;">enterobius vermicularis</i>
infection?
<div>
  {{c1::Supportive therapy}}
</div>

### Extra
Neither albendazole or pyrantel pamoate have been properly studied
in pregnancy
<div>
  Pharmaceutical treatment for pinworm infection in pregnancy
  should only be considered in cases with severe symptoms in which
  the pregnancy may be compromised (e.g. weight loss,
  sleeplessness), and preferably not until the third trimester when
  the risk to the fetus is likely to be reduced
</div>
<div>
  However, in most cases, enterobiasis does not pose any risk to
  the fetus or the mother and treatment can be delayed until after
  delivery
</div>
<div>
  Supportive therapy includes strict hygiene measures to avoid
  spread of infection
