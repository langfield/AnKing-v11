### Text
Below is an ECG with {{c1::premature atrial complexes}}
<div><img src="big_5980571921976.jpg"></div>

### Extra
<div>
  Sinus rhythm with a heart rate of approx. 55â€“62/min (borderline
  bradycardia) Normal heart axis (R > S in both I and aVF)
</div>
<div>
  Both normal and deformed P waves can be seen. As the occurrence
  of P waves is variable, PR intervals are not consistent. Abnormal
  P waves are generally followed by narrow QRS complexes.
  Occasionally, there is aberrant conduction with broadening of
  QRS, as seen in the first beat in III.
</div>
<div>
  The fourth QRS complex in lead II represents an exemplary APB,
  preceded by a deformed P wave. Note that no full compensatory
  pause is present (the RR interval between the preceding and the
  following normal QRS complexes is less than twice the normal RR
  interval).
</div>
<div>
  Diagnosis: atrial premature beats
