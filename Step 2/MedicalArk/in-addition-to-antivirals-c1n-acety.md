### Text
In addition to antivirals, {{c1::N-acetylcysteine}} improves
<i>transplant-free survival</i> even in patients with
<b>non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure</b>

### Extra
In addition, this patient's acute (viral) hepatitis makes her more
susceptible to hepatotoxins that may contribute to liver failure,
including acetaminophen
<div>
  Patients with fulminant liver failure should be transferred to an
  intensive care unit at an active liver transplant center, as
  worsening encephalopathy and coagulopathy might make a later
  transfer difficult
</div>
<div>
  subsequent management includes close monitoring as well as
  treating the underlying cause (e.g. tenofovir for hepatitis B
  infection in this patient) and complications such as coagulopathy
  and/or encephalopathy
