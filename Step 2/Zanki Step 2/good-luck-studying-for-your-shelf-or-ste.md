### Text
Good luck studying for your shelf or step 2 or whatever exam it may
be!
<div>
  If you score well - congratulations! If your score isn't quite
  what you had hoped, congratulate yourself on how hard you worked
  and know that life will find a way to work itself out.

<div>
  Medical student and physician depression/suicide is a major
  epidemic that isn't talked about enough. If you think someone you
  know is feeling down, ask how they're doing! If you're feeling
  down, please don't be afraid to ask for help.
  <div>
    I hope you have found these decks useful. May your medical
    career have many successes.
  </div>

    With love,
